# aimentalhealthassistant

A Flutter project used for creating MyKindBuddy, an AI-powered Mental Health Assistant Application, which is a friendly companion and helps build your mental health.

#App Usage

MyKindBuddy is designed to help users actively monitor and care for their mental well-being through simple, daily interactions. Here’s how users typically engage with the app:

📝 Daily Journaling:
Users can write freely about their thoughts and feelings in a secure, private journal. The app provides a calm space for emotional expression.

📊 Mood Tracking:
After journaling, the app uses AI sentiment analysis (via Amazon Comprehend) to detect the emotional tone of entries and visualize mood trends over time.

🤖 AI-Powered Reflection:
OpenAI GPT‑4 processes journal input and generates empathetic, human-like responses that encourage self-awareness and emotional validation.

🔒 Secure Access:
Users authenticate securely via Amazon Cognito, ensuring that personal entries remain private and protected.

📈 Emotional Insight Over Time:
With consistent use, users can reflect on how their emotions shift across days or weeks, helping them understand patterns and triggers.
